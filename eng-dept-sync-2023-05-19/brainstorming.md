Demos:

Blog Project.

Purpose:

Demos:

* Student projects: 
  * https://beamscene.fly.dev/
  * https://github.com/einariii/beamscene

* Tailwind Playground.
* Blog project. (UML Diagram would be nice)

What We've Done
* Beta
* First Official Cohort
* Demo Day

Notable Numbers
* ~550+ stars on Github
* ~182 forks
* ~10 community mentors
* ~16 beta testers
* ~10 students
* ~11 confirmed applications (so far) for our first paid cohort.

Values
* DYA way: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vm1cOc871KF8nodYl11xYDPm4vo6FFVwjSmAfYgqXM/edit
* Practicality
* Engagement
* Collaboration and Community
* Excellence
* Humilty
* Student Driven

Developing a Community
* Friday AED sessions
* Daily 1hr mentor sessions 8:30am - 9:30am PT. Different mentors every day 4 days a week.
* Weekly Student 1-1s
* A low stress environment for a high stress activity
* Creating a culture where "I don't know" is celebrated, while still making sure students engage with the material.
* Normalizing emotions and stress. Taking the time to emotionally prepare students.
  * Every major section we expect students to feel stress as the world gets "bigger" (OTP, Phoenix, LiveView, etc)
* Leveraging the EN community
* Students on the EN podcast
* Students on the DY Elixir Roundtable
* Students creating community supporting projects (ElixirWPM, Elixir Wordle, etc)

Improving Content
* Shifting towards project-focused content (pie diagram would be fun)
  * Group Conversation
  * Mob Programming
  * Group work
  * Independent Project Work
* Moving away from follow-along tutorials in favor of more open-ended projects with more comprehensive/interactive reading material
* Having seen certain common struggles we now attempt to get ahead of the issue
  * route conflicts
  * embedding elixir terms in HTML (particularly for associated data)

Student presentations
  * Student-led Review Sessions
  * Group Project
  * Capstone Project

Struggles
* How do we create interactive content for certain topics?
* How do we provide both breadth and depth? Where do we want to fall?
* How do we deliver information and content? Shifted away. No lectures, moving away from follow-along teaching in favor of mob programming. We use the material as a support and I guide the class through a session. I describe the project requirements, and students rotate being the navigator to describe the next step of project development. When topics become pertinent, that's when I may take a moment for a short explanation on the topic. This keeps information relevant and timely.

Teaching problem solving
* Focus on Testing and avoiding "whack-a-mole" development.
* Small step programming.
* Scientific Debugging (observe, hypothesis, verify)
* Pair programming
* Mob programming
* Database Diagramming
